## Prompt for LLM model to pass with CSV files and get json output of filtered contracts

dei_prompt = """
    I have the following CSV files: 

    Process these files with the following parameters: 
    
    Analyze the attached CSV of government awards to identify:
        - DEI Contracts: Live contracts end date after March 2025 with "diversity," "equity," "inclusion," "DEI," "DEIA," or "DEBIA" in `prime_award_base_transaction_description`. 
            - Look for other DEI keywords like inclusion, gender, equity, diversity, LGBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQ+, etc.
            - These align with the Executive Order targeting DEI waste.

    For each:
    - Extract `award_id_piid`, `current_total_value_of_award`, `prime_award_base_transaction_description`, `period_of_performance_current_end_date` and `recipient_name`.
    - Flag if live: end date after March 2025.
    - By analyzing the description of the award makea determination if we can consider this a DEI contract based on the use of DEI keywords.
    - It is important to reduce the total number of contracts to only the ones we should focus our attention. 
    - Only keep contracts that have a high probability of being part of DEI initiative. 
    - Use the description of the already canceled contracts from https://doge.gov/savings as a reference to flag contracts on the provided text.
    - If undecided best not to include the award in the output JSON.
    - Summarize the description for each award but keep the keywords in the original text. Make them as short as possible.
    - Double check if the contract is live by using the https://www.fpds.gov/ ezSearch and review all modification to make determine if the contract has been terminated it. E.g. "terminted for convinience", "close out" or updated end date is before March 2025.

    Rules:
    - Go to https://doge.gov/savings and look at the contract descriptions in the list ot understand the mission criticality. Use the descriptions on the websiteto flag contracts on the provided text.
    - Case-insensitive keyword search.
    - Ignore terminated/expired rows, end date after March 2025.
    - Do not add awards that that are clear mission-critical (e.g., "aircraft maintenance" is fine, "training" alone isn’t).  
    - Output as a JSON file with a list called `doge_targets`.
    - Make output JSON as compact as possible only including `id`, `amount`, `description`, and `recipient`.

    Example Output:
    {   
        "doge_targets": [
            {"id": "75P00123P00067", "amount": 500000, "description": "Training", "recipient": "Me, LLC"},
